                        The female African lions who hunt together and kill together also appear to take a noncompetitive approach to mating and taking care of cubs.

                        A 36-year study of about 560 female lions in Tanzania shows that they do not establish a hierarchy that lets some of them breed more than others, researchers reported last week in the journal Science.
                        
                        This egalitarianism is highly unusual in animals that live in social groups. It contrasts greatly with the mating behavior of other status-conscious mammalian predators -- and with the behavior of male lions.
                        
                        Dr. Craig Packer, a behavioral ecologist at the University of Minnesota who led the study, said the female lions experienced approximately equal reproductive success and even cooperated with one another in raising the cubs.
